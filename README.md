-------------------
The project has 5 exclusive features : 

- This project has use of React,MongoDB database, Firebase for authentication purpose , CSS framework in it. The use of React Router makes it a SPA(Single Page Application) Website.

- The theme is based on A Food and Beverage Brand shop, where the products come entirely from what a user adds in the Add product page.
- A user can sign up and login with their email or Google. The use of private routing limits the access to certain pages for example: Details page, add product page and update everything needs the user to get thorough the process of authentication first.
- The use of database is something new and different here. Whenever a user adds a product , it stores in the database when necessary the data can be retrieved from the Database . A user can also update the data they included already or delete the added product which is again by the use of CRUD operations.
- In every step, there is use of alerts, which informs the user either the action they are trying to do is successful or not.
